# Creative Combat Stunts (PF2e & 5e)

brings more life and agency into combat. 
Instead of flat rolls, players can commit to stunts before they act, with outcomes tied to success or failure. This adds tension, drama, and roleplay choices back into each turn.

## Install
**Recommended:** In Foundry's Module Browser, search: *Creative Combat Stunts* (after approval in the directory).  
**Manual:** Paste this Manifest URL into Foundry:  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rraiten/foundry-creative-combat-stunts/main/module.json`

### What it does
- ‚ú® **Liven Up Combat**: Transform routine attack rolls into cinematic, roleplay-driven moments.  
- üé≠ **Player Agency**: Give players meaningful decisions before dice are rolled, keeping the spotlight on their creativity.  
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Smooth Integration**: Dialogs and chat cards make it quick and seamless in play.  
- üìú **System Support**: Built-in adapters for Pathfinder 2e & D&D 5e ensure outcomes follow each system‚Äôs rules.

## Usage
1. Enable the module in **Game Settings ‚Üí Manage Modules**.  
2. Select a token and open **Stunt Dialog** from the token HUD / macro (if you add one).  
3. Choose a stunt, confirm, and let the adapter apply outcomes.

## How it actually works
1. Reward players for roleplaying cool stunts with flat bonuses, advantage, special statuses or a draw from a critical deck.
2. Allows a fail-forward for important combat narrative moments - no more describing in details a great moment only to fail the roll to no effect.
3. Balance risk-reward you can make the DC higher for a more rewarding effect, but also risk getting a condition if you fail.
4. Introdudce an optional cinematic points pool to be used by the party on importatnt boss fights.
5. Allow the GM to spice up boss encounters by making the boss tougher yet allow the party to exploit weaknesses and turn the battle in their favor.
